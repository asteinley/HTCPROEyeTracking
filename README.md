# HTCPROEyeTracking
A repository of scripts and (what I find to be) useful tools for utilizing the eye tracking built in to the HTC PRO Eye. 

## GetCoords.cs
A Unity script intended to print the coordinates of a GameObject to a text file every frame. Supposedly, this GameObject is attached to the TobiiXR GazeVisualizer.
